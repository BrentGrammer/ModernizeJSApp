# Modernize an Application

- This is an experimental project meant to figure out how to add tooling and bundlers such as Vite, Parcel, ESBuild or Webpack to a app using vanilla JavaScript, Lucee and no tooling.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop

## Run the app

- `docker compose up`
- Go to http://localhost:8080

## Branches

- Each branch is an iteration of the app trying out different tooling and setup. 
- Consult the README in the branch for prerequisites and documentation.
